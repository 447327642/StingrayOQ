StingrayOQ
==========
This is an Execution Provider for OpenQuant (www.smartquant.com/openquant.php) 
and Interactive Brokers (www.interactivebrokers.com)

OpenQuant (OQ) is a development, simulation and execution software for trading systems.
Interactive Brokers (IB) is a big Broker.
StingrayOQ is an execution provider plugin which connects OpenQuant and Interactive Brokers.

StingrayOQ is a replacement for the native IB plugin which comes with OQ.
It has these features:

* full support for FA accounts
* allows Orders and executions be i´dentified with an unique OrderRef. this allows for a robust synchronisation even afetr crashes.


I started this project because I needed a robust plugin for several accounts (within an FAstructure) at IB.
I created very similar plugins for WealthLab 4 (http://wl4.wealth-lab.com) and RightEdge (www.rightedgesystems.com) before.

Using StingrayOQ
================
To use StingrayOQ you need just two files:

StingrayOQ.dll
Krs.Ats.IBNet96.dll

copy these files into the OpenQuant bin folder (typically C:\Program Files\SmartQuant Ltd\OpenQuant\Bin)

In OpenQuant go to Tools->Options->Configuration->Providers->User
Click "Add" and choose StingrayOQ.dll

Then go to Tools->Options->Configuration->Modes
In the field "Live->Execution Provider" choose StingrayOQ


Build form sources
==================

To build the StingrayOQ project you'll need to set two references:

OpenQuant.API should refer to OpenQuant.API.DLL in <SmartQuantInstallDir>\OpenQuant\Bin, typically C:\Program Files\SmartQuant Ltd\OpenQuant\Bin
Krs.Ats.IBNet96 should refer to Krs.Ats.IBNet96.DLL 

You may get this DLL from Dinosaur Technology and Trading (http://www.dinosaurtech.com) or http://code.google.com/p/ib-csharp
