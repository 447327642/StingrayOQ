StingrayOQ
==========
This is an Execution Provider for OpenQuant (www.smartquant.com/openquant.php) 
and Interactive Brokers (www.interactivebrokers.com)

OpenQuant (OQ) is a development, simulation and execution software for trading systems.
Interactive Brokers (IB) is a big Broker.
StingrayOQ is an execution provider plugin which connects OpenQuant and Interactive Brokers.

StingrayOQ is a replacement for the native IB plugin which comes with OQ.
It has these features:

* full support for FA accounts
* allows Orders and executions be i´dentified with an unique OrderRef. this allows for a robust synchronisation even afetr crashes.


I started this project because I needed a robust plugin for several accounts (within an FAstructure) at IB.
I created very similar plugins for WealthLab 4 (http://wl4.wealth-lab.com) and RightEdge (www.rightedgesystems.com) before.
